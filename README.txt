This program copies files to specified locations using a CSV file.

The CSV file must be named file_map.csv.

The first row of file_map.csv is reserved for column headers, and
is ignored by the program.

The first column of file_map.csv should list the names of files to
be copied. The new file path should be in the second column.

Specifying a new file name is optional.

See file_maps.csv for examples.
